      <p>Except for the few students who "just get it", learning to program can be frustrating and, worse, boring. Educators have tried for years to make computer science more engaging by programming robots, IoT devices, and even video games. But each of these causes more problems than they solve. Robots are expensive, creating a bottleneck to learning, with four or more students to a single robot. IoT devices are complex, requiring low-level coding that is beyond the reach of most beginners. Video games require extensive background knowledge in 2D and 3D graphics. There must be a better way to engage students in programming! 
      <br><br>
        We started Code Beats because we believe there is a better way to learn programming: by making music. We teach computational thinking via a curriculum where (1) students learn how to code to manipulate and create hip hop beats and (2) students experience computation. As students make beats, they, almost without noticing, learn fundamental concepts and skills of computer science. If your child has an interest in music and hiphop beats, our courses are a way to explore their interests while, at the same time, learn the increasingly important skill of programming.
      <br><br><br>
        About - Code Beats started as a senior project in VCU's College of Engineering. This project asked the question: can realistic-sounding hip hop beats be generated via code? In the fall of 2019, four students explored this question by re-creating popular beats, such as Still Dre and Russian Cream. They quickly discovered that code could generate high-quality, realistic-sounding beats!

        Our Goal - <br><br>
        “Our ultimate goal is to create the next generation of scientists, engineers, technologists and mathematicians through our program,” said Davell Smith, assistant principal at Martin Luther King Jr. Middle School. “Right now, African Americans, females and minorities are underrepresented in STEM professions. So the goal is to spark their interest as they become sixth-graders, and as they grow up they may want to be able to actually create something that they can use to help the community or pursue a career [in STEM].” So, we figure why not use music to help the youth become engaged more with STEM programs and influence more potential STEM careers. If our program sounds like something that would be beneficial for your community please contact us at <a href=codebeatsteam@gmail.com>codebeatsteam@gmail.com.</a>

        Student Feedback from Our Program <br>
        "This was a very engaging, fun and enlightening experience"  <br>
        "It was cool to sit in the class and learn something I did not know about." <br>

     "I wish this was not the end. I would love to see VCU expand the program." <br>

    "Very Informative and useful information that could be career changing" <br>
        
        "I really enjoyed learning and having fun in this class. It was a pleasure working with everyone. I like how the activities are fun and how there is a cool project at the end to showcase our hard work and efforts." <br>

"I am glad I took this class, because I know so much more about coding and making a melody and a rhythm using a coding language." <br>

"Great introductory class! Love that you can go back to view a missed session!" <br>

"It was a good mix of lecture style with live instructor and those by video. I'm also glad there was a hands-on portion during class. Although I didn't attend the extra help sessions, it was also great to have that option." <br>

“I wanted to learn code and I love rap”  <br>

"i love coding and music and my best friend is also joining. I have been playing drums my entire life. seriously its true." <br>
        
        “Because my dad is a software developer, i like coding, and i love piano.”  <br>

"I joined this "class" because I love coding and I love different kinds of beats and music. This is perfect!"  <br>

"For fun and also learning to code with music. Also I love music so I was like why not make it. I went to the apple store and just made my beats with garage band" <br> 

"I’m very interested in beats like dr.dre and I saw this so I want to make or create beats" <br>

"I wanted a fun way to earn coding badges for girl scouts."  <br>

"Because I have had experience with JavaScript and Python, and ply 4 different instruments and I think this class ties it in pretty well."  <br>

"I make rap and hip hop beats on garage band and if I want to make a beat, other people have to dig it so I can get advice" <br>

“I love coding and music, so code music is my thing!”  <br>

"First #codebeats assignment" <br>

"@davidcshepherd more beats by djcoopnasty. #codebeats #coding" <br>

"Day 3 of #codebeats !! I tried..!" <br>

"Khalil started #codebeats today!! He was so excited to hear his beat once he was done!" <br>
